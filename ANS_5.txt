5. If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you
will choose as your partner and why?

--> I would like to choose One of my friend Shubham Goel (CSE) because he is full
    of energy, passionate, honest about his work and will be helpful in creating a 
    great network for the company, he will be very helpful in maintaining the client trust for the company.

--> Secondly I would like to choose my friend Deepanshu Singh (CSE) because he has very good problem solving skills and 
    great capability to look into complex problems and understand them properly.
